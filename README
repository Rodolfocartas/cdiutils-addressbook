CdiUtils AddressBook is a project which demonstrates the use of CDI 
(and CDI Utils add-on) in Vaadin projects.

The source originates from Vaadin Address Book -tutorial (https://vaadin.com/tutorial) 
but most parts of the project have been re-written to utilize CDI and CDI Utils
add-on (and MVP-pattern).
The classes under package org.vaadin.virkki.cdiutils.addressbook.ui.list contain most
of the documentation related to the changes.



CdiUtils AddressBook can be deployed to any JavaEE6 (Web Profile)-compatible container
(I've tested it on Glassfish 3.1 and JBoss AS7).

1. Clone the project to your workspace
2. Add the necessary libraries under WEB-INF/lib:
	-Latest Vaadin library: https://vaadin.com/download
	-Latest CDI Utils add-on: https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/cdi-utils
	-(If deploying to JBoss AS, due to a bug in the container also
	gwt-user.jar is needed: http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html)
3. Deploy
